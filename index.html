    <div style="margin-top: 15px; display: flex; justify-content: space-between">

        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;font-size:large;">
          Snipe eels have curved beaks that resemble those of birds. The eels sweep their beaks through the water to
          entangle the antennae of delectable shrimp. Their beaks are coated in small, hooked teeth.
          With comparatively large eyes, snipe eels invest their limited biological resources on seeing predators in the
          middle of the dark ocean, my love. They don't have any bioluminescent bells and whistles, unlike many twilight
          zone inhabitants, yet their dark brown or grey bodies blend into the darkness.
          Diverse kinds of snipe eels have been caught in waters as deep as 4,500 metres, either by themselves or in the
          stomachs of other fish (14,800 feet). They are typically found at altitudes of 300 to 600 metres, or 1,000 to
          2,000 feet. Young eels, also referred to as leptocephali, are translucent and flat like other eels, allowing
          them to blend in with their surroundings in the warm surface layers of tropical and temperate oceans.

          The snipe eel has extraordinarily long upper and lower jaws that curve apart at the extremities.
          This shows that they avoid one another when the eel closes its mouth.
          These curved jaws can help the eel catch its prey.
          Small shrimp and other crustaceans can be caught using the small hooked teeth that cover the mouth.
          The shrimp's antenna is caught in the open mouth of the eel by tiny, backward-facing teeth..
          Like many deep sea species, the snipe eel has relatively large eyes for its size.
          These large eyes help it to capture the little light that penetrates the darkness of the deep water.
          The fins are almost totally black, while the body is a variety of shades from dark brown to grey.
          Guys age differently than women because their mouths shorten and they lose their teeth. This disparity led
          scientists to initially think that the sexes belonged to different species.
          The ways in which the snipe eel reproduces are not fully understood. It is well known that after the female
          lays the eggs, the male fertilises them externally. Since the eggs are buoyant, they will float in the water
          until they hatch. Once they hatch, the small larvae are shaped like leaves.
          Actually, they'll shrink a bit before they grow and develop into adults.
